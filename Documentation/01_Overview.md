## Penguin Language
Penguin language (or 'penguin-lang') is designed to be a programming language that is easy-to-use, easy-to-understand, and concurrent-friendly. 

Following is a minimal hello-world examle:
```
initial {
	print("hello world from penguin-lang!");
}
```

Penguin-lang is inspired from multiple languages:
* Syntax from Python
* Garbage collect from C#/Java
* Type system from Rust
* Asynchronization or co-routines from Golang
* Paralleling from Verilog/SystemC
