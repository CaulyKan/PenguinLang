## Penguin Language
Penguin language (or 'penguin-lang') is designed to be a programming language that is easy-to-use, easy-to-understand, and concurrent-friendly. 

Following is a minimal hello-world examle:
```
initial {
	println("hello world from penguin-lang!");
}
```

Penguin-lang is inspired from multiple languages:
* Syntax from C#
* Garbage collect from C#/Java
* Type system from Rust
* Async/Co-routines from C#/Rust(Tokio)
* Thread-safety from Erlang
* Timing model from Verilog/SystemC
