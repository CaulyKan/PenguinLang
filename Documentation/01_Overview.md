## Penguin Language
Penguin language (or 'penguin-lang') is designed to be a programming language that is modern, easy-to-understand, and concurrent-friendly.

The following is a minimal hello-world example:
```
initial {
	println("hello world from penguin-lang!");
}
```

Penguin-lang is inspired by multiple languages:
* Syntax from C#
* Garbage collection from C#/Java
* Type system from Rust
* Async/coroutines from C#/Rust (Tokio)
* Thread-safety from Erlang
* Timing model from Verilog/SystemC
